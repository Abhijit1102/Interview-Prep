# 🧠 Interview Preparation Repository

This repository contains my structured preparation for Software Engineering interviews.
The goal of this repo is **consistency, clarity, and revision-friendly learning** — not just solving problems, but understanding patterns and system thinking.

It is an evolving repository. More topics, notes, and implementations will be added over time as my preparation grows.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repo

* Build strong problem-solving ability
* Prepare for product-based company interviews
* Maintain revision notes in one place
* Track my learning journey

This repository is intentionally written in a way that **future me can revise quickly before interviews**.

## 🚧 Future Additions

Planned folders:

* `database/` → SQL + Indexing + Query optimization
* `os/` → Operating System concepts
* `networking/` → HTTP, TCP/IP, DNS
* `behavioral/` → HR & behavioral interview preparation

## 📅 Study Philosophy

> Small progress daily beats random 10-hour bursts.

I focus on:

* understanding patterns instead of memorizing
* writing clean readable code
* revising frequently
